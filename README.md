## Running Locally

To run this project (with all patterns) locally, first clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns.git
cd angular-design-patterns
```

Then you may run `yarn && yarn start` to start a local server.

## Folder Structure

All our design patterns are located inside `/src/app/pages`.

```
└── /src/app
    |── /pages                              // individual design patterns
    └── /services                           // logics controlling the side navigation
```
